# Onshape-Integration-Guides
This repository holds a series of brief introductions to various Onshape integration methods
- `API_Intro.md`: a guide to set up and make REST API calls to Onshape documents in Python 
- `Flask_Intro.md`: a guide to integrate a simple Python Flask web application to the Onshape user interface 

Sample projects demonstrating the capability of REST API calls and Flask app integration in Onshape: 
- A project that builds and simulates the motion of a simple four-bar mechanism can be found [here](https://github.com/PTC-Education/Four-Bar-Mechanism). 
- A project that builds a heat sink design with automatic generation of its heat transfer ability can be found [here](https://github.com/PTC-Education/Heat-Sink-Design).
